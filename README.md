This is a capstone group project of my Master of Data Science degree in The University of Hong Kong. The project is jointly developed by Alex Lau, Guo Huimin and Xie Jun.  

In this capstone project, we developed a deep learning-based local navigation system for the visually impaired users. The system enables users to both make sense of and navigate along their surrounding environment. The system is prototyped in Python and it offers 3 special features:  
1. A state-of-the-art segmentation module that supports **low latency (more than 20 FPS) with remarkable segmentation performance**
2. A **scene understanding module** for summarising spatial scene into grid of objects  
3. An **Obstacle avoidance module** for detection of closest obstacle  

We integrated all modules into an interface developed by PyQt5 and the system was tested in indoor scenes.
